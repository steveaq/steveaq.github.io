# About

Hi, my name is Stephen Ahiabah-Quarshie 

I am currently a Quantitive Risk Analyst @ Nawest Group. Over the course of the last few years, I've found my passion in the world of ML and sports analytics has massively grown, so I decided to start this blog to learn more about these topics in public. From coding to tactics and also, applications of ML in football.

In this blog I’ll write about some things I learnt along the way, starting from zero, to what I’m working on today.

Feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/stephenaq7)!

Steve
