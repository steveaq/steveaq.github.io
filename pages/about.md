Introducing Pitch IQ - Your Football Analytics Insight

Welcome to Pitch IQ, a personal and insightful football analytics platform created by a passionate hobbyist football data scientist. We dive into the world of football, exploring concepts and finance rarely explored on the internet. Our goal is to provide you with unique and in-depth insights that go beyond traditional statistics.

At Pitch IQ, we love football, and we love analyzing it. Our platform is a place where we combine our passion for the game with data-driven analysis. We aim to share our knowledge and offer a fresh perspective that helps you appreciate the nuances of football on and off the pitch.

You can find all our longer more academic style posts on the Pitch IQ substack page, but that's not all. We've created an additional substack blog called Cannon IQ, dedicated entirely to our beloved Arsenal. As die-hard Gunners fans, we delve into the rich history, tactics, player analysis, and financial dynamics specific to Arsenal. Cannon IQ is our way of connecting with fellow Arsenal enthusiasts and offering a unique perspective on our favorite club.
